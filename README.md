# Take Home Project for GiveCampus

## About
A take home project to assess skills. This todo app was developed using React and bundled with `parcel-bundler` because I don't like the bloated libraries that comes from using `create-react-app`.  

### Features
Tasks are stored in `localStorage` for persistence. User can delete tasks or mark them as complete and style reacts dynamically to its status. 

### Future Features
- Allow user to set reminders.
- Persist change when user edits due date in cards.
